# FakeJobsScrapper
 
Learning how to Scrap static website using Request and Beautiful Soup Libraries
This Scrapper Fetch HTML from a static website "https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/" specifically designed to teach web scrapping to a newbie
The Scrapper then collects "Job title", "Company Name" and "Location" from the web page and put the data in a csv file named as "joboffer.csv"

This is just a first web scrapper ever built by me
